            <p>From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br />
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br />
But as the riper should by time decease,<br />
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br />
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br />
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br />
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br />
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br />
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br />
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br />
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sonnet" id="2">
            <h2 class="hding">2.</h2>
            When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, <br />
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, <br />
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: <br />
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies, <br />
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, <br />
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes, <br />
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.<br />
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, <br />
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine <br />
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,' <br />
Proving his beauty by succession thine! <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This were to be new made when thou art old, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
        </div>
        <div class="sonnet" id="3">
            <h2 class="hding">3.</h2>
            <p>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest <br />
Now is the time that face should form another; <br />
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, <br />
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother,<br />
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb <br />
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? <br />
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb <br />
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? <br />
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<br />
Calls back the lovely April of her prime: <br />
So thou through windows of thine age shall see<br />
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if thou live, remember'd not to be, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die single, and thine image dies with thee.<br />

        <div class="sonnet" id="4">
            <h2 class="hding">4.</h2>
            <p>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend <br />
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? <br />
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<br />
And being frank she lends to those are free. 
<br />Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse <br />
The bounteous largess given thee to give? <br />
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use <br />
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<br />
For having traffic with thyself alone, <br />
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.<br />
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone, <br />
What acceptable audit canst thou leave? <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, used, lives th' executor to be.</p>

        <div class="sonnet" id="5">
            <h2 class="hding">5.</h2>
            <p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame <br />
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, <br />
Will play the tyrants to the very same <br />
And that unfair which fairly doth excel: <br />
For never-resting time leads summer on <br />
To hideous winter and confounds him there; <br />
Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br />
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where: <br />
Then, were not summer's distillation left, <br />
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, <br />
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, <br />
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,<br />

O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<br />
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,<br />
A dearer birth than this his love had brought, <br />
To march in ranks of better equipage: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since he died and poets better prove,<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'

                Full many a glorious morning have I seen <br />
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,<br />
Kissing with golden face the meadows green, <br />
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; <br />
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride <br />
With ugly rack on his celestial face, <br />
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br />
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br />
Even so my sun one early morn did shine <br />
With all triumphant splendor on my brow; <br />
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine, <br />
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now. <br />
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth; <br />
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke? <br />
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br />
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, <br />
For no man well of such a salve can speak <br />
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:<br />
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief; <br />

I found, or thought I found, you did exceed<br /> 
The barren tender of a poet's debt;<br /> 
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br />
That you yourself being extant well might show<br />
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br /> 
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<br /> 
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br /> 
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;<br />

When others would give life and bring a tomb.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lives more life in one of your fair eyes<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than both your poets can in praise devise.

                What's in the brain that ink may character <br>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?<br> 
What's new to speak, what new to register, <br>
That may express my love or thy dear merit? <br>
Nothing sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,<br> 
I must, each day say o'er the very same, <br>
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<br> 
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name. <br>
So that eternal love in love's fresh case <br>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age, <br>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, <br>
But makes antiquity for aye his page, <br>
Finding the first conceit of love there bred<br> 
Where time and outward form would show it dead.

Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.<br> 
As easy might I from myself depart <br>
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie: <br>
That is my home of love: if I have ranged, <br>
Like him that travels I return again, <br>
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<br> 
So that myself bring water for my stain. <br>
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd <br>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, <br>
That it could so preposterously be stain'd, <br>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; <br>
For nothing this wide universe I call, <br>
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.

Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br> 
Made old offences of affections new; <br>
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth<br> 
Askance and strangely: but, by all above, <br>
These blenches gave my heart another youth, <br>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love. <br>
Now all is done, have what shall have no end: <br>
Mine appetite I never more will grind <br>
On newer proof, to try an older friend, <br>
A god in love, to whom I am confined. <br>

For that deep wound it gives my friend and me! <br />
Is't not enough to torture me alone, <br />
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?<br />
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, <br />
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd: <br />
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken; <br />
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.<br />
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, <br />
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;<br />
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard; <br />

Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one. <br />
In things of great receipt with ease we prove <br />

Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. <br />
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, <br />

Simply I credit her false speaking tongue: <br />
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd. <br />
But wherefore says she not she is unjust? <br />
And wherefore say not I that I am old? <br />
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust, <br />
